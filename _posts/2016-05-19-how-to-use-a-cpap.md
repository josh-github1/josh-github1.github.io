## Introduction

In this article, I describe how to use a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device. You might be wondering why someone like me is using one. Having sleep apnea depends on multiple factors like the structure of a person's build (you can have a high body mass index with no sleep apnea) and where in their body that the fat is distributed - I think it just so happens that I may be susceptible to it. I use a CPAP because I feel awake after using it and I enjoy the peace of mind. I may not actually have the condition, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

A common issue with CPAP users is that they give up on therapy because of the difficulty of using and caring for the equipment. It smells, it's too tight, it falls off at night, taking care of the mask is a burden, etc. This article addresses pain points and hurdles that I had to overcome over the years that I've been using the thing. This article makes the assumption that you are using a full-face mask. I'm writing this for my own equipment - Resmed Airsense 11 and an Airfit F20 full face mask with heated tubing. If you fall into this category, I urge you not to sleep on this article. I've used my CPAP machine with 99% consistency. As proof, you can look at this window of data from the Resmed application for the dates from february 2022 to 2023.

From the above figure, on average I sleep for 7 hours and 50 minutes with an average AHI of 0.8. 7-9 hours is what the CDC recommends and an AHI < 5 is considered normal range.  

You can disregard the cases where I use it for a long time like 9-12 hours. I just sometimes like to sleep in or sleep late on a weekend - the machine's timing resets at 9 am and this throws off the data. The other 1% cases where I use it for < 4 hours are instances where I accidentally take it off and just sleep for most of the night without it. There is also a small portion of instances where I use it for > 4 hours but not for the entire night that I'm sleeping - these are instances where I take off the mask without knowing I did, only to later wake up again to put it back on. Realistically speaking, one may not expect perfection with this device (as with most things in life). 

## How to Fix The Cpap Issues

First Things First

To address these issues, try to buy the following:

TODO: Add figures and list of stuff

###  Issue 1: The Mask and Equipment Smells
Probably the biggest issue for me was that my equipment smelled.

I recommend the routine cleaning of the mask to be really thorough. Use unscented dish soap that is mild and contains natural ingredients. My go-to brand is Seventh Generation. I'm probably an unofficial ambassador for Seventh Generation dish soap. According to Resmed, the standard way to wash the mask is to submerge it in soapy water for ~30 minutes then to rinse it off. If you're not a mouth breather or you sleep with your mouth closed, then you're in luck because that full face mask probably isn't going to smell that bad from your breathe or saliva. This method should work in theory.

However, from personal experience and as someone who is a slight mouth breather and has a sensitive nose, this method really does not work. The cushion actually ends up with a faint saliva smell that can get worse or unbearable as the night goes on. One way to prevent this from happening is to have a rigorous cleaning method.

#### My Cleaning/Maintenance Method

After you've submerged the mask in soapy water for ~30 minutes, wipe down the cushion again with soap and water vigorously. Lastly, place the full mask set (except for the straps) in a UVC light box and have that UVC box run for at least half the day. For the tube, fill it with some amount of unscented soapy water and swish it around, covering both ends with your hand. The tank can just be filled with unscented soapy water. Rinsing and leaving out to dry is the last step for both items.

You can also set a reminder for yourself to replace the cushion every month and the full mask set every 3 months (according to Resmed). Although others may say that this is really a scheme for Resmed to make more money, I've personally found that the timing on replacing these parts can actually be fairly accurate. After a certain time, the smell from the equipment will be hard to remove. There is often a musty smell that lingers despite all the cleaning that I put the equipment through. I've found that a solution is to just replace the mask or hose at that point. Again, everyone's experience may be different.

#### Have a Contingency Plan
You may also want to have CPAP mask wipes by your bedside in case your mask ends up smelling in the middle of the night. These are highly useful and I've found that the citrus scented wipes can remove and mask smells for long enough until you fall asleep. If this doesn't work, I have also found it very useful to have a backup mask in case the first one ends up smelling in the middle of the night. In different circles, this is considered practicing redundancy.

#### Take Preventative Action
Another thing you can do is place odor absorbing bags (e.g. Moso bags) near (not blocking) the air intake of your machine. Although the next line might be funny, it's also true: If you pass gas in the middle of the night, that smell is going to go into your CPAP's air intake. As you may already know, the CPAP is absorbing air from the room to force it into your lungs. So if you pass gas, the smell will go directly to you. The odor absorbing bag will mitigate or prevent the smell from reaching you. I've found that this method really does work (or just keep the smell contained in the blankets but there's no guarantee that you'll keep the blankets on completely while you're asleep).

### Issue 2: The Mask Falls Off at Night
The worst case scenario is that the mask falls off at night and drops on the floor. This is really bad. One should have a 'hook' for their CPAP mask to loop the tubing through. That way their mask is much less likely to fall off of their bed in the middle of the night.

### Issue 3: I feel like I can't breathe through the mask
There can be several reasons for this. You might feel claustrophobic, in which case your body is reacting by making it difficult to breathe. I recommend just having the mask on throughout the day until you're used to it. If this is solved or if this is not the case and the issue is still happening, then it may be that your nose is clogging up due to allergies or the temperature and humidity of the forced air. If it's allergies, I recommend taking care by using Flonase each night and to try allergy shots. Increasing the temperature and humidity of the heated tubing until your nose feels comfortable enough to not close up should also help. This is all done through trial and error, everyone responds differently to their machine.

### Issue 4: Water splashes onto my face from the tube
Get heated tubing and adjust the temperature and humidity settings until you find what works for you. Wrap the heated tubing in specialty tube wraps. Double wrapping is good too. This will ensure no water or condensated water splashes onto one's face in most temperature conditions.

### Issue 5: The Machine's Pressure Is Too High or I Still Have Apneas
Do everything you can to mitigate apneas. Start sleeping on an incline pillow, lower your body fat, do throat exercises, and try sleeping on your side. All this in combination will lower the number of times the machine adjusts its pressure as well as the max pressure to prevent the apneas from happening, thus ensuring a comfortable time asleep.

### Issue 6: Taking Care of The Equipment Is a Burden
I agree that doing all of this maintenance work is a burden. If someone could make a machine that autofills a tub with soapy water, rinses the equipment for you but without high temperatures, and runs the equipment through a final stage of UVC light exposure, then I would instantly buy it. Unfortunately, such a device does not exist yet and if it does, then please let me know. However, there are machines that can partially automate the work for you and can do a good job of cleaning and de-odorizing your equipment.

The first machine is an ultrasonic cleaner. If you want your mask or tank medical-grade clean and with minimal traces of dirt, saliva, or other mouth-related organics, then this could be the machine for you. I use the ultrasonic cleaner by iSonic -

I use a cleaner that's large enough to fit a tank and two full face masks like the following:

I personally like to wash the tank (daily), mask (daily), and tube (weekly) separately. For the full face masks, fill the tub with soapy water and run a cycle for ~20 minutes or so with no heat. Always remember that high heat can damage your equipment. The next part is rinsing which is also a burden. Thankfully, there exist table top dishwashers that have non-heat cycles that run for ~20 minutes.
